Slide transitioning is available on both editing slide page and preview.

Visibility:

Our website's functionality and controls are very straight forward and very easy 
to see.
This start from the welcome page, the user can easily be taken to Login page or
welcome page by pressing on the buttons. If they want to go back to the welcome page,
they can just press the back button.

In the main dashboard, user is able to very easily identify all the actions, as 
all the button and clickable page have a stand out color or card layout.

Then in the making presentation slides page, we have made each clickable button 
as icons, so it represents on what action each button can do.

We also put similar actions button into groups, so it very easy for user to find
the action they want to do. 

If they click on an action which results in a modal to appear, it also have titles
on the top which tells the user what process/step/action they are on. 

If the screen size become smaller, we also have put group of icons into a menu bar,
so for users on mobile devices, they can just open the menu and find the action they 
want to perform. Rather than all the icons been squashed together which make it hard
to press and see. 

Affordance:

We also made each action button into bright colors or stand out colors, so it very
easy for user to find these buttons. 

The button also hovers, when user put the cursor on the button. This way the user
knows they can press on it. 

Feedback:

When the user finished an action, effects can be shown on the screen straight away.
If they fail on doing something, such as register using a same email, an error pop up
will also appear. 

Consistency:

Our main dashboard and editing slides page color scheme is the same. Log out
button also always appear at the same place.

When changing slides, all the control stays at the same place.

Our modal to allow for user input is also the same layout through out the application. 

Constraints:

We also have constraints on elements, such as if you are on first slide, you can't
click on the previous slide button as you don't have a previous slide.

If you only have one slide, you can't delete that slide. 

If the use is not logged in, then they can't create slides. 

Efficiency:
Our website is very minmal and straight forward. User can easily find the action they can
do. There is no hidden button. Each button is either labelled or have an icon indicating
on what the button do. There are no complicated steps.
