For accessbility we have the following:

We have good contrast in my website, which help people with low vision. 

We also have aria label whenever we can for input, so the screen reader
can read it. => better usability. 

We also have alt text for our image which adverse user experience for screen
reader users and low bandwidth users.

We have enabled enter key functionality in our login and register page, which 
make it easier for navigate between pages.
